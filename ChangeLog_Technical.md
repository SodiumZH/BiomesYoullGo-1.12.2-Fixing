## 1.8

Decompiled: obtained correct source code, and we no longer use the compiled pack

Temporarily removed all 5 unimplemented mobs.

Classes/Files/Paths renamed: removed all "MCreator" tags in names.

Added class SmeltingRegistry to register new smelting recipes.

Remade mcmod.info: the former one doesn't work, and now it's located at src/main/resources.

Removed data/recipe, as they don't work at all.

Categorized recipes in assets/recipe into several subfolders and changed the file names human-readables.

反编译：获取了正确的源码，不再使用编译后的包

类/文件/路径重命名：移除了所有的"MCreator"

加入了SmeltingRegistry类以注册新的烧炼配方

重做了mcmod.info：原有的有问题，现在位于src/main/resources.

移除了data/recipe文件夹，其中的配方完全不起作用。
